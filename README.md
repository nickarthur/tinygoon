# Tiny Goon

Tiny Goon is a multiplayer action game, designed to work for 2 to 4 gamepads. It's heavily inspired by Towerfall Ascension.

Tiny Goon was made using Goo Create.

# Browser support

Something in the Gamepad API changed, which makes it break in newer browsers. It seems to work in Chrome 42 though.
